Search Box
Use “Refine Search” for filtering the list according to the given criteria. The search syntax is the following:
FIELD_NAME_1=[TERM_11 AND TERM_12 OR TERM_13…] OR FIELD_NAME_2=[TERM_21] AND …
FIELD_NAME corresponds either to the name of the field in the database, declared as field_FIELD_NAME, or one of the following fields of the user table
	Name, email, role, date* (of registration)
The same FIELD_NAME can be used several times. For AND and OR “&&”, “&” and “||”, ”|” can be also used accordingly. The search and also the logical operators are not case sensitive. 
* For the date a special syntax is used: date=[START_DATE, END_DATE]. If the START_DATE is skipped, i.e. date=[,END_DATE], there won’t be a START_DATE used, and if END_DATE is skipped, i.e. date=[START_DATE,], as the upper limit the current date will be used. If only one date is given, i.e. date=[DATE], then it will be used as the starting date. All the PHP supported syntaxes can be used to specify a date.
NOT logical operation can be also used with the terms, in the following form:
NOT(TERM)
While typing in the search box, smart autocomplete is provided. After typing FIELD_NAME=, “[“ is added automatically. In the list provided by the autocomplete, multiple options can be selected by checking (SPACEBAR must be used) the checkboxes in front of the terms. To confirm the selection press ENTER. The terms are added with AND logical operator. For the “date” a calendar is provided.
